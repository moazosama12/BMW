<div ><h2>BMW x1</h2>
<p>BMW's entry-level SUV, the X1, has been a favorite of ours for some time thanks to its agile handling, eager nature, and practical shape. The 2023 model has received a complete redesign that looks to be a comprehensive upgrade over last year's model, with improvements to its chassis, powertrain, and interior. A new 241-hp turbocharged four-cylinder engine is under the hood and is paired with standard all-wheel drive and a seven-speed automatic transmission. Unlike its main rival, the Mercedes-Benz GLB-class, the X1 remains a two-row SUV, but its slightly larger exterior dimensions have translated to extra space inside the cabin according to BMW. Speaking of the interior, it's updated with a more modern design and the latest tech features, including the brand's iDrive 8 infotainment setup</p>

 <h2>BMW XM</h2>
 <P>BMW’s M performance division, purveyor of land rockets like the M3 and M5 sedans, has dropped a hot-rod SUV on the tall-speedster class. Slotting above the three-row X7 in BMW's SUV lineup, the new XM is an all-new two-row crossover with serious sporting intentions. The 2023 XM’s styling is inspired by the XM Concept from 2021. Although toned down, it’s still an aggressive design with gaping kidney-shaped grille openings, stacked tailpipes, and a slightly sloped roof that hints at a fastback shape. Under the hood is a 644-hp plug-in hybrid powertrain that gets its muscle from a twin-turbocharged V-8. About 30 miles of electric-only driving should be possible with a fully charged battery but it's the XM's performance potential that has our interest piqued. We’ve driven a pre-production prototype, and our first impression is that the new SUV is going to prove as worthy of its M badge as its well-respected sedan cousins.</P>

 <h2>BMW 7</h2>
 <p>An entirely new generation of the 7-series, long BMW's flagship sedan and the brand's most luxurious and advanced product, has debuted for the 2023 model year. The formula doesn't change much from the current car's: powertrains include a turbocharged inline-six and a twin-turbo V-8, with a plug-in hybrid joining the lineup later. On our initial test drive, we found that the 7-series veritably floats down the road. Its handling is a little lither than the 2022 car's thanks to some changes to the chassis and suspension, including a new rear-wheel steering system. Its driver-assistance tech provides a hands-free driving mode for highway slogs but the car's showstopping feature is an optional 31.3-inch rear entertainment display called Theater Screen that drops from the ceiling and streams TV and movies using the onboard Wi-Fi system.</p>
